# Generating Low-Depth Quantum Variational Circuits for the Hydroxyl Cation to Attain High Fidelity on NISQ Computers

This is the Positive Technology Lab at Rice University's submission for the [2023 Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery Challenge at ICCAD](https://qccontest.github.io/QC-Contest/index.html).

## Usage
1. In your terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/positivetechnologylab/ptl-iccad-contest-2023.git` to clone the repository.
2. Run `cd ptl-iccad-contest-2023`.
3. Create a virtual environment if necessary, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.
4. Run `python main.py <noisemodel_name> <seed> [shots]>`, where
    - `noisemodel_name` is either `fakecairo`, `fakekolkata`, or `fakemontreal`
    - `seed` is an integer representing the seed to use
    - `shots` is an integer representing the number of shots used
5. To interpret the results, there is a line in the output with the following format: `Accuracy Score: __%`. This is the accuracy score for that particular run.

## Requirements
The requirements and specific versions are provided in `requirements.txt`.

## Notebook Usage
1. In your terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/positivetechnologylab/ptl-iccad-contest-2023.git` to clone the repository.
2. Run `cd ptl-iccad-contest-2023`.
3. Create a virtual environment if necessary, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.
4. Navigate to the 'icacd_prod_workflow_doc_ipynb' notebook.
5. In the section below **Initialize Configuration Variables**, specify the seed to use in the 'seed' variable, and the name of the noise model to use ('fakecairo', 'fakekolkata', or 'fakemontreal').
6. Run all cells in the notebook.
7. One of the cells will print out the accuracy score in the following format: `Accuracy Score: __%`. This is the accuracy score for that particular run.

## Notes
We'd like to note that our Python workflow incorporates the Qiskit estimator for evaluating the quantum circuits, inspired from the provided [Noise Model and System Model code](https://github.com/qccontest/QC-Contest-Demo/blob/main/NoiseModel_and_SystemModel.ipynb).

## For Developers
If you would like to customize the workflow, the `iccad_prod_workflow_doc.py` files provides Python functions that break down parts of the workflow and can be modified to suit your needs. In particular, `obtain_parameterized_ansatz` runs VQE and returns the parameterized UCCSD ansatz, `compile_circ_bqskit` compiles an input circuit using our BQSKit workflow, and `evaluate_circuit` uses the Qiskit Estimator class to evaluate a transpiled circuit on the FakeMontreal() backend.
